IN ORDER TO GET setport_CO2 to work the following needs to be done in the BASH Session:

1: Must set a bash alias if wanting to run program from anywhere in a BASH Session
    -in the .bash_aliases file add the following line of code, save the file and restart BASH Session (this only needs to be done once):
   
    alias setport='cd /"path_to_parentDirectory"/;./setport.cpp.o'
   
    **literal example from my environment:
    alias setport='cd /home/ubuntu/workspace/setport_CO2/;./setport.cpp.o'
    
    -if desired, setport.cpp.o is not required; do the following
        -in the desired directory run the following 
        
        make setport
       
        -this will create an executable in the same directory called setport
            -then an alias can be created for that executable (the following line would be added to the .bash_aliases file
           
                alias setport='cd /"path_to_parentDirectory"/;./setport'
                
                **literal example from my environment:
                alias setport='cd /home/ubuntu/workspace/setport_CO2/;./setport'

2: Must set environmental variables (this must be done once per BASH Session)
    -run the following commands:
    
    export MY_PORT=123
    export YOUR_PORT=789
   
    -This will set the MY_PORT and YOUR_PORT environmental variables
   
    -to check that this was done right the following commands can be run:
   
    printenv | grep MY_PORT
    printenv | grep YOUR_PORT
